My name is Yitzac Gastelum. I'm currently working on a few cybersecurity-related projects and plan to post my progress here along the way. Some of these include:  

- Raspberry pi-hole
- Setting up an SIEM and performing red team attacks on it while also defending
- Etc

More to come along the way...

### My background

Studying Computer Information Systems with a focus on cybersecurity at Cal Poly Pomona. My interest in cybersecurity was heavily influenced by software development, such as creating bots. Creating bots and configuring them to do specific tasks involving networking and other niche stuff caught my interest.
